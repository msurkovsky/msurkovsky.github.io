**Lessons from Our First Startup Accelerator**

We thought we were building a helpful app for busy parents.  
We ended up building something vague, bloated, and unfinished.  
A mentor gave us the advice that changed everything...

---

It was May 2023.

Our daughter had just started eating regular food. One afternoon, after finishing a stressful meal prep, my wife looked at me and said:  
*"It would be great to have a simple app that could help me plan and prep meals for her."*

It sounded like a small, useful idea — something real we could build together.

I’d known about the Green Light accelerator for years. Every time, I thought about applying… and then didn’t.  
But this time was different.  
This time, I really wanted to try.  
Applications didn’t open until October, so I had time to think.

And that’s when I started overthinking.

## Overthinking Phase

Instead of just building what my wife needed, I started scaling it in my head.

*"What if we don’t just help with baby food?"*  
*"What if we optimize cooking for all busy parents?"*  
*"What if we bring professional kitchen workflows into the home kitchen?"*

It felt more ambitious. More pitch-worthy.  
So we went with that version — and got accepted.

That felt like a win.

At the intro session, they asked us:  
**“Who is your customer?”**

I answered something like:  
*"Everyone. Everyone eats. Everyone cooks. We want to help busy people cook better."*

But over the next month, we kept circling the same question.  
And we couldn’t really answer it.  
Worse — we didn’t understand why it mattered so much.

## The Comment That Changed Everything

It was the last workshop before Christmas: elevator pitch night.

The workshop itself wasn’t the breakthrough. What came after was.

I was speaking with one of the mentors — casually, after the event — and told him I was still struggling with that one question:  
*“Why is it so important to know exactly who your customer is?”*

He looked at me and said:  
*"If your product is for everyone, then it’s also for 15-year-olds. Have you ever seen a 15-year-old cook? They’re not trying to make food — they’re trying to make a mess for TikTok."*

Then he said something that stuck with me:  
**“Make it for 15 years old.”**

Not literally — but make it **specific**, **focused**, **real**.

That’s when I remembered where the idea actually came from.  
Not from pitch decks or personas — from my wife, struggling in our kitchen.

She didn’t want a big platform or a cooking revolution.  
She wanted help — with something simple.

An app that helps parents prep meals for their kids.

And when I pitched that version — the original version — people got it.  
They leaned in. They gave feedback. They engaged.

That was the first real moment of traction.  
Not because we added something. But because we went back to what mattered.

## The Outcome

So, did we succeed?

No.

We didn’t launch.  
We didn’t scale.  
We didn’t leave the accelerator with a winning product.

We failed — and honestly, not just because we didn’t define our audience.  
We spent too long trying to figure out what the MVP even was. We couldn’t finish.

Later, I realized something else: this might just be a **tarpit idea**.

It’s one of those ideas that everyone says “yes” to — because it sounds useful.  
But when it comes time to actually use it, no one really cares.  
It’s easy to nod to, hard to commit to.  
And that’s on us. We didn’t test it early enough. We didn’t challenge the “yes.”

But we did learn something we’ll take forward.

## The Real Lesson

When you try to build for everyone, you end up building for no one.  
**Make it for 15 years old.**

Start specific.  
Make it clear.  
Make it real.  
And make sure someone truly cares.

## A Question for You

Have you ever found yourself working on something — only to realize you’d lost sight of the person you were trying to help?

Next time you’re building something and it starts to feel too broad, too blurry —  
Picture a 15-year-old flooding the kitchen with pancake batter.

Then go back.  
**Make it for 15 years old.**
