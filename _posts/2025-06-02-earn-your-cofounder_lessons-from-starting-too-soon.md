**Our start-up journey reached the zombie state**

Nomlify drifted into a zombie state: just two of us left, both barely involved, yet neither willing to have the tough conversation about shutting down or restarting. Most of our energy went into endless syncs, with almost nothing to show for it by the next meeting. Eventually, I decided to let go and start fresh, only to discover that finding someone eager to join me wasn’t as easy as I thought.

It was June 2024, and I found myself gripping the steering wheel on the drive home, replaying the last few months in my head. Our team had nearly fallen apart; Nomlify, the project we’d poured so much into, was on life support. I kept calling my co-founder — my friend — hoping that maybe, this time, we’d finally have the talk we needed. On my eighth try, the call connected, though I had the sense he’d only picked up by accident.

At that point, I wasn’t even sure what I wanted anymore. I just knew I couldn’t keep dragging the project forward by myself. The weight of trying to keep Nomlify alive was becoming too much, and the idea of starting over, with someone equally invested, began to feel like the only way forward.

A few weeks later, frustrated but still restless, I reached out to another friend — someone I admired for his startup experience and sharp, entrepreneurial mindset. I didn’t have a concrete idea in mind; what I really wanted was a partner to brainstorm with, someone who could bring fresh energy and maybe help spark the next big thing.

But when I pitched the vague prospect of “let’s do something together,” his answer surprised me. He told me, almost apologetically, that he gets these kinds of invitations all the time—and always turns them down. His time, he explained, was too limited to commit to something without a clear vision or focus. I’ll admit, I didn’t get it at first. For me, the idea of just starting, of figuring it out together, felt exciting. But for him, it was a non-starter.

Still, we agreed to keep in touch. Maybe, we decided, we’d just call each other from time to time, swap ideas, and see if anything clicked. It wasn’t the partnership I had in mind, but it was something — a seed, if nothing else.

Months later, I stumbled onto a book that changed how I thought about all of this — Running Lean by Ash Maurya. One chapter hit especially hard: trying to form a co-founder team too early can lead straight into some familiar traps. I’d already seen it with Nomlify: groupthink, unclear direction, and diluted ownership. I realized I was repeating old mistakes without even noticing.

**Earn your co-founder.**

The truth is, the hardest — and most necessary — steps are the lonely ones at the very start. Before you look for a partner, you have to wrestle your own idea into shape. Only once you’ve found a model that might actually work, you do have something real to offer, something worth joining.

If there’s one thing I wish I’d realized sooner, it’s this: Start alone. Give the idea a backbone. Only then will you be able to answer the hard questions when the right co-founder comes along, and only then will they really want to join you.

Maybe that lesson saves you some time, or maybe it just helps you feel less alone if you’re somewhere on the same road. If you’ve ever struggled with finding the right co-founder, or wondered if you’re going about it the wrong way, I’d love to hear your story. What was your turning point? Let’s share our lessons.
